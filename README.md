# KeyPad
A small program written on C++ that allows to interpretate some gamepad actions as mouse or keyboard

It uses Xinput library to recieve commands from connected Xbox 360 controller.

It does not include own virtual keyboard, so I recommnend you to download one from site https://freevirtualkeyboard.com/.
You should name it "FreeVK.exe" and put it into some PATH folder(for example C:\Windows, etc or just in same folder with program)
